\chapter*{Abstract}

This thesis deals with the transformation and analysis of functional programs. We show how to make functional programs shorter, faster and safer. Throughout, we work on a core lazy functional language, to which Haskell programs can be reduced. We present examples, develop prototype tools and show detailed results for sample program.

We make programs \textit{shorter} by defining a library which abstracts over common data traversal patterns, removing \textit{boilerplate} code. Our library restricts traversals to have value-specific behaviour for just one type, allowing a simpler programming model. Our library allows concise expression of traversals with competitive performance.

We make programs \textit{faster} by applying a variant of \textit{supercompilation} to core programs. We have implemented a supercompiler, and test it using standard Haskell benchmarks. As a result of our practical experiments, we have identified modifications to the standard supercompilation techniques -- particularly with respect to let bindings and the generalisation technique.

We make programs \textit{safer} by automatically checking for potential pattern-match errors. We define a transformation that takes a higher-order program and produces an equivalent program with fewer functional values, typically a first-order program. We then define an analysis on a first-order language which checks statically that, despite the possible use of partial (or non-exhaustive) pattern matching, no pattern-match failure can occur.

\chapter*{Declaration}

Chapter \ref{chp:background} has some overlap with material published in \cite{me:yhc_core}. Chapter \ref{chp:uniplate} is based on the paper \cite{me:uniplate}, which appeared at the Haskell Workshop 2007. Chapter \ref{chp:supero} is based on the paper \cite{me:supero_ifl} which was presented at IFL 2007, and the revised paper \cite{me:supero} which has been accepted into the post proceedings. Chapter \ref{chp:firstify} is based on the paper \cite{me:firstify_icfp} which has been submitted to ICFP 2008. Chapter \ref{chp:catch} follows on from the original papers \cite{me:catch_tfp_original,me:catch_tfp} presented at TFP 2005 and appearing in the post proceedings, and is based on the paper \cite{me:catch_icfp} submitted to ICFP 2008.

Expect for the above cases and where stated, all of the work contained within this thesis represents the original contribution of the author.
